A casual spot in Nolita, Kimika serves Japanese Italian fusion brunch. Was excited to try their matcha mochi french toast but it was kind of disappointing. Otherwise, their Katsu burger was tasty with a good balance of flavors and soft milk bread.

Service and ambience were nothing special. On the pricer side for the quantity of food (the burger was small).
