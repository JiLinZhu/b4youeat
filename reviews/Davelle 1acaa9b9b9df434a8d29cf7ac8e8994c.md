Cute, cozy brunch spot with amazing and creative food! The katsu was amazing and their uni pasta was a surprise hit. All the toasts looked so good, we had the sesame and cream cheese. I would recommend sharing dishes as some of the dishes like the uni pasta can get kinda heavy.

I would also avoid ordering the special drinks. The matcha au lait was way too sweet and the black sesame kinako latte was average. Would recommend just going for classic drinks like matcha latte.

Otherwise, great spot for a brunch with reasonable prices.
