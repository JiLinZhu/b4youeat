Great spot for a semi-casual meal with a variety of chicken options. My personal favorite is the poached chicken, which comes with a spicy garlic sauce for mixing. Their other options are also great; ask for the spicy sauce and they'll add it on for free!

My only wish is that the food came out hotter. Also, the chicken does lack a bit of flavor, though this makes it less heavy if that's what you're looking for.

The space is relatively small, so while great for a catch up with a friend, it won't fit a group very well. Relatively cheap too!
