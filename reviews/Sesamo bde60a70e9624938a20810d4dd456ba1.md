# Sesamo

Sesamo attempts to combine Asian and Italian flavors in a stylish space. While the atmosphere was on point and service was good, the drinks and food were very disappointing.

To start off, we got the Dragoncello and Mango Boba. Both these were boring, watery, and just didn't really have any character. The boba drink was especially weird as the boba wasn't chewy - it had the texture of salmon roe... why??

None of the dishes were impressive either. The burrata was meh with a few slices of tomatoes. The mackerel carbonara was average but didn't standout. The Japanese eggplant was almost good - the eggplant part was delicious but the capers and olive mix on top was way too salty. And to finish off, the black tea creme brulee didn't taste of any tea.
