One of my favorite Korean spots in the city! Great for small groups to get drinks (the cocktails are cheap for NY standards) and share some delicious plates. The service is super attentive, better than many Michelin restaurants.

The food is delicious! Loved everything we got, from the pork soup, some of the best Korean fried chicken I've had, and seafood pancake.

Will definitely be coming back.
