Dim sum spot near ktown. Tons of classic dishes including some great dumplings.

My personal favorite was the rice cakes, bouncy and delicious. The soup dumplings were also really juicy, however I would recommend sticking to the more classic flavors. The assorted was a bit gimmicky, truffle doesn't go with everything.

Ambience was nice and service was fast. They were blasting the AC tho..
