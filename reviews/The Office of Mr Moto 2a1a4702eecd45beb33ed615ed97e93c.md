# The Office of Mr. Moto

Behind an unmarked entrance with a secret keycode to enter, The Office of Mr. Moto serves omakase at ~$200. This gimmick and the well-decorated space popularized the restaurant with its mysterious atmosphere.

While the head chef is very kind and the service is solid, Mr. Moto has a huge flaw. The course preparation isn't only done by the head chef. Multiple chefs create inconsistencies, this was even worse because the other chef clearly didn't take his job very seriously.

Not only was he less skilled (rice portions were different each time), he also didn't care about the details. He would leave a few grains of rice left on top of the fish or pour too much sauce by accident. The worst was when the nigiri literally fell apart. I watched him realize, place the fish on top, and serve it anyways.

While he didn't serve our party, these details cheapen the experience. The fish quality was still great and the courses were delicious. However, at this price range, that doesn't really earn you bonus points.
