# Cafe China

Rating: ★★★★★★★★★
To Post: No

Located just south of Bryant Park, Cafe China serves authentic Szechuan food in a casual atmosphere. While not as flashy and trendy as newer restaurants, Cafe China’s food is comparable to places like Szechuan Mountain House, one of my favorites in the city. 

We were welcomed and seated quickly in the balcony area, a fun and unique dining experience.

I don’t usually write a rave review about a single dish, but the Smoked Bamboo Shoot was probably my favorite dish in the past few months. I’d come back for this dish alone. 

We also ordered the Curiously Tasty Chicken and Beef Tripe in Chili Sauce. The beef tripe was good, it was just spicy enough to be enjoyable — although I would prefer it spicer. The chicken was slightly odd. It was very tender but I didn’t love the flavor profile of fish sauce and oyster sauce.

We finished up the meal with Rice Wine Soup. The texture was great, chewy but not sticking to your teeth. 

Overall, Cafe China makes my top 3 Chinese spots in the city and definitely deserves another visit.
