# I Sodi

Rating: ★★★
To Post: Yes

Located in West Village, an area with great Italian options like L’Artusi and Don Angie, I Sodi has tough competition next door.

Unfortunately, it fell well short of its neighbors and other Italian spots in the city. While it has a nice dimly lit ambiance with good service, the food was where it started going downhill.

We started with fried artichoke, which was disappointing. Essentially a pile of deep-fried crunchy artichokes that tasted like grease. For the mains, we had lasagna and cacio e pepe. The lasagna was heavy and dry. The pasta was fine but a bit over-salted. Across the board, the presentation of all the dishes sucked.

And to wrap it up, we spotted a mouse/rat in the outdoor garden dining area. Yes, it's outdoors — but come on now…
