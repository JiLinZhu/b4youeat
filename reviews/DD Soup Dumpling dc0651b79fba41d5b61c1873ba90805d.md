# DD Soup Dumpling

Rating: ★★★★★★
To Post: No

A casual, no frills, chinese food spot. It's a good spot for a quick bite and the food is pretty cheap for New York standards. We had a variety of dumplings, the shumai was great but the rest were just ok. Still, for the price and amount of food, pretty good!
