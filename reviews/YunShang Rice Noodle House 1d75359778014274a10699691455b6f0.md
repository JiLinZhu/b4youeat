# YunShang Rice Noodle House

Rating: ★★★★★★
To Post: No

A small chain that mainly serves a steaming stone pot soup where you add a variety of toppings and chewy noodles. Its a great spot if you're craving noodles or a warm broth. The texture of the noodles was great, though I think the soup lacked a bit of flavor (still pretty good though). I would recommend the original soup if it's your first time trying, the pickled soup was slightly odd.

Other than the food, the place is well decorated and service is responsive. Food was also extremely affordable and their appetizer was HUGE.

Party Size - 2

Price - $40 (we were extremely full).
