Before I lose you - take the elevator! There's complimentary wine!

A pretty good spot for a date with a super spacious, open concept kitchen. The service is nice - although even when asked, our waiter didn't provide much help with the wine menu.

While the food is pretty good, I unfortunately found most the dishes to be a bit salty for my taste, especially the chicken and the ravioli dishes. The tagliatelle was better, but still doesn't beat similar Italian spots in the city.

I had previously visited last year and it had been better so perhaps just a one-off.

TLDR - There are better spots purely for food but the atmosphere definitely doesn't miss.
