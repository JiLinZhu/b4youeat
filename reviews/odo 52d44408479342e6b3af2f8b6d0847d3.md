Behind a hidden door in a cocktail bar, you’ll find Odo. It’s a closed-off room with a very intimate atmosphere, seating only about a dozen people. We were warmly greeted and quickly shown our seats. The service was attentive yet very subtle, creating a perfect atmosphere to highlight the food: a Japanese kaiseki menu.

The meal began with an amuse-bouche, a delicious savory and umami-rich broad bean soup topped with caviar. Following this were the sashimi and mushroom dashi soup courses. While these were tasty, I felt they lacked creativity and uniqueness.

Next, the duck course was good but far from the best; it was less tender than expected, almost chewy. We wrapped up the meal with wagyu hotpot and rice courses. The wagyu was delicious, and the self-cooking aspect allowed us to control the doneness of the meat. It was interesting to compare a rare cook with one closer to well done.

The one true standout was the dessert, a strawberry ice cream topped with strawberries. It might just be the best ice cream I’ve ever had. I was mildly unimpressed by the construction, though. It seemed like someone forgot to unfreeze the ice cream as they struggled to get it out of the tub. The plating was also inconsistent with toppings falling off and the ice cream melting by the time the last few were done.

Overall, kaiseki was an experience that required attention to detail to fully appreciate. Odo focuses on the quality of ingredients and the simplicity of each course, without resorting to gold flakes for vanity or excessive caviar. However, this left some courses feeling simple and uninteresting. It had some standout moments but also felt like it needed some refinements.
