Mari offers a Korean hand-roll tasting menu complemented by a few other dishes. Mari emulates a slightly chaotic and lively energy. It’s a tad unusual for a Michelin spot but not necessarily good or bad.

The service at Mari was top-notch. Our water and drinks were constantly being refilled, showcasing the attentiveness of the staff. However, the atmosphere was just okay. We were seated in the dining room rather than around the island counter. If you get a chance, opt for the counter seating to enjoy the open kitchen experience, which seems much more engaging and dynamic. I felt like the dining room area was disappointing - especially if you’re sat in a corner. 

As for the food, the hand rolls were good but not exceptional. I liked the creative construction but felt it lacked a wow factor. The true standout was the duck noodle course. The duck was perfectly tender with a bit of fatty skin and served with a delicious sauce. It was probably the best duck dish I've had in any NYC restaurant, Michelin included. Another highlight was the palette cleanser/first dessert. It was creamy, light, and had a great mouthfeel.

Overall, Mari is a good spot if you’re looking for a Michelin spot with a more casual atmosphere. It has standout courses but also areas that can be improved on. In particular, its dining room vs counter seating.
