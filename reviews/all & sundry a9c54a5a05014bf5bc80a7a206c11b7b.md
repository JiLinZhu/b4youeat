# all & sundry

A intimate bar located near Columbus Circle that also serves brunch.

While the food was pretty good (slightly under seasoned but still very tasty), the vibe doesn't fit your typical brunch. The restaurant is dimly lit and the tables aren't large enough to comfortable place multiple dishes.

Really enjoyed the sundry burger! Tasty and not overly messy to eat.
