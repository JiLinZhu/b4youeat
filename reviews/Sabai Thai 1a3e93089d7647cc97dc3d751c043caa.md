# Sabai Thai

To Post: No

Adorned with a modern interior and high ceilings, Sabai Thai’s initial impression promises elevated Thai cuisine in an upscale atmosphere.

To my disappointment, the food fell way short of expectations. The Khao Pad Kra Pow was plain bad and one of the worst I’ve had. The chicken was bland, the rice was hard, and the egg was overcooked. We also ordered the pineapple duck curry which turned out average. The curry lacked flavor and the duck was generic and unflavored as well. 

We were originally going to finish with the mango sticky rice which looked amazing in the pictures but decided otherwise based on the dinner.

I’d recommend trying out the large selection of other Thai options in NYC, most of which are also cheaper than Sabai. There are tons of great options including Mitr Thai, Pranakhon, and Soothr just to list a few.
