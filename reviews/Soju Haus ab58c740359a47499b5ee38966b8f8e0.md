# Soju Haus

Rating: ★★★★★★★★★
To Post: No

One of my favorite spots for what they do - lots of drinks and casual food with a lively yet upscale atmosphere. Think of it as a fancier Pocha 32 (without a wait if you come before ~8pm!) with free fried eggs and rice! Service is super friendly! Don't know why it's rated so poorly. If you're looking for an easy to get into place to have some fun and drink soju - this is def the spot. Waiting in line for an hour in Ktown just ain't the vibe sometimes. It is on the pricier side - but not insane. $40pp for 4 dishes and 2 bottles of soju (we ordered too much food too).
