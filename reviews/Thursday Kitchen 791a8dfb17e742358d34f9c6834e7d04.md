# Thursday Kitchen

A cozy spot in East Village, Thursday Kitchen differentiates itself from the many Korean restaurants in NY by serving Korean-style tapas and juice box drinks in a casual environment. It’s a fun spot to share good food and try a variety of flavors. 

All the tapas we tried were great. My two favorites were the edamame dumplings with a delicious creamy filling and the lucky noodles with good bounce and a kick of spice. The dishes all leaned acidic though, and some could do without the squeeze of yuzu/citrus.

The service and atmosphere were both solid. The space is a bit crammed though and there is a scent of truffle that fills the restaurant. It smelled good but perhaps they need a bit more ventilation.

It's relatively easy to walk into and overall a good pick if you're looking for something more unique than BCD Tofu and more casual than the contemporary Korean spots in the area.
