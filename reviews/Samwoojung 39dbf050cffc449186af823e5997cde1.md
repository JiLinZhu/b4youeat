Great Korean spot specializing in bulgogi with a delicious Seoul-style broth. I typically don't love grilled bulgogi, but this dish was great! It had the warmth of a soup but also the fun of a KBBQ. The glass noodles that come with the bulgogi were super bouncy too!

Their chicken cold noodle dish was also a hit, super refreshing and great to balance the stronger flavored bulgogi.

My only nitpick is that the service, while super friendly, was a bit lackluster. Our server said he would bring us more side dishes but then never came back and the dessert was served while the bowls and plates from the food was still all over the table. We also tried to communicate that the metal platter on the stove was sliding around and felt like it was going to slide off, but our server didn't seem to quite understand the issue. To be fair, it was their first day opening though.

Overall, would love to come back and try out some of their other items!
