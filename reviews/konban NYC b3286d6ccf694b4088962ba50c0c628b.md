Hidden way in an alley in Chelsea you’ll find konban NYC, an izakaya-style restaurant serving a variety of Japanese dishes. It boasts a sophisticated atmosphere with great lighting and traditional decor. The outdoor rock garden and wood-framed windows gave it the feeling of a restaurant in Kyoto.

Upon entering, you’ll be greeted loudly by the staff in traditional Japanese fashion. The service is great, with the staff quickly bringing water, a snack, and a complementary small drink. 

We ordered a variety of dishes including the popular pork loin katsu and the butter scallop. Both of these were rich, flavorful, and overall just very well made. At only $16, the katsu was worth it, although traditionally this is served with rice and shredded cabbage which would be nice to balance out the dish.

We also ordered the eggplant agebitashi and the uni shari. The eggplant was tasty but lacked some uniqueness and didn’t hit the mark. The uni shari was unfortunately pretty disappointing. The quality of the uni was quite bad and overall the flavor combination didn’t taste good.

Overall, I’d say konban is worth a visit, just make sure you order the right things!
