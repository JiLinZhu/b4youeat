A trendy speakeasy hidden in the "storage room" of an ice cream store. Great vibes and all their drinks are super creative and fun.

I would say it's one of the better speakeasy's in the city mainly because it's much easier to get into with or without a res. One downside is that the tables for 2 are really small and close to others, would recommend going with 4-6 and getting a reservation instead.
