Average casual spot for Malaysian dishes. None of the dishes really stood out and lacked uniqueness. But overall the food was tasty and slightly cheaper than average.

Ordering is done at the counter (kind of like fast food), and food is brought out to your table.

Went with a large group so I got to sample a bunch of dishes. Nothing bad but nothing exceptional either.
