# Seoul Salon NYC

To Post: No

Joining the likes of Ariari, Atoboy, and others in Hand Hospitality collection of restaurants, Seoul Salon brings an imagination of a Korean bar and Korean drinking culture to NY. While it’s a cool place to grab some drinks, the food is one of Hand Hospitality’s rare misses.

Stepping into the restaurant was surprising. It is insanely spacious, especially considering its proximity to Ktown where all the restaurants can be a bit too cozy for comfort. The venue is quite stylish with flat walls and a dimly lit atmosphere, although it may be a bit too dark if you're seated in a booth. The ambiance, coupled with the music selection, gave off more of a club or high-end bar vibe rather than a restaurant. Unfortunately, the food seems to match this theme. Although it's intended to be bar or drinking food, the dishes fail to live up to their promises.

The Mala Pork Belly looked super exciting, but in reality wasn’t mala at all. It wasn’t bad… it just wasn’t good either. 

The worst dish had to be the Littleneck Clam soup. Soups are usually my favorite dishes at Korean spots; I was expecting something umami, light to drink, and warm for a cold day. Unfortunately, this soup had way too many spicy peppers, which overpowered the subtle flavors of the clams. I like spicy food… just not when it makes the soup unpleasant to drink. On top of this, the clams were also tough to chew… I didn't know this was possible, tbh.

That said, I’ll still give this place a 5/10. It’s a cool drinking spot; perhaps I just wasn’t drunk enough to appreciate the food.

Upon entering the restaurant, I was taken aback by the spaciousness of it, especially since it's located in Ktown where restaurants typically have limited space. The venue is quite stylish with flat walls and a dimly lit atmosphere, although it may be a bit too dark if you're seated in a booth. The ambiance, coupled with the music selection, gave off more of a club or high-end bar vibe rather than a restaurant. Regrettably, the food aligns with this theme.
