# Szechuan Mountain House

Rating: ★★★★★★★★★★
To Post: No

A must go for anyone that like Chinese Szechuan food, some of the best, authentic dishes I've had outside of ChengDu.

Absolutely loved everything, from the mouth watering swinging pork belly, to the best MaPo tofu in the city by far, and the delicious (and not insanely spicy) eggplant.

The service was great and the ambiance was on point. Tons of detail in the decor and it actually felt like a restaurant you may see in ChengDu (without the absurd humidity).

Oh and as a tip, if you don't have a res, add yourself to the waitlist by phone before going!
