# Mala Project (Midtown)

Pretty good spot for a create your own mala dry pot and other Chinese dishes. The dry pot was flavorful but not really mala (numbing spice). The best part is that you can choose your favorite ingredients giving you a lot of flexibility.

Service was standard and ambiance was casual.

Overall, if you're looking for authentic Szechuan food, try out other places like Mountain House instead. But for some good Chinese food, this is a great spot.
