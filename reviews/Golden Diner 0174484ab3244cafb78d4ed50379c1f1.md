# Golden Diner

A fun spot setup like a picture-perfect diner (exactly what you would imagine when you think of the world).

It had some delicious burgers and pancakes! We came for dinner so perhaps not a great time to be eating pancakes, but still enjoyed it!

Make a reservation before you come, walk-in wait times can get long during peak hours!
