# Okdongsik

While choosing between a variety of unique appetizers and tasty entrees is fun, it can be a bit of a paradox of choice. Sometimes it’s nice to have no choice but a warm hearth soup and some plump juice dumplings.

Okdongsik is perfect if you’re in that mood. It serves up a simple Gomtang, topped with pork and scallions. It’s not too oily and overall perfect for the cold NY winter (summer soup is different). Make sure to also get the dumplings, they were the highlight dish for me. You’ll get 4 plump mandoos filled with delicious kimchi, tofu, and pork!

Overall, great service and atmosphere. Come with a friend, get a soup each, and share an order of mandoo! Oh and if you want to continue your night, my favorite speakeasy in the city is accessible without leaving the restaurant. I’ll leave you to figure out where!
