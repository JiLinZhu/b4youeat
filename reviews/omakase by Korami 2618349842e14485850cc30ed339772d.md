Rating: ★★★★★★★
To Post: Yes

Omakase by Korami stands out as an affordable omakase option in NYC, offering great value comparable to spots like Shinn East.

All the cuts we had were very fresh, showcasing the quality of the ingredients. My only nitpick was the scallop and uni courses, which tasted fishier than I would have liked. In particular, the squid was very fishy - though this one is probably just how it’s supposed to taste.

One of the standout features of Omakase by Korami is the pacing. Most affordable omakase spots in NY rush to turn tables. The pacing here felt just right, allowing for a more relaxed and enjoyable dining experience.

Overall, I would recommend Omakase by Korami as a great entry spot for those new to omakase. While there’s room for improvement with certain items, the overall value makes it a worthy visit.
