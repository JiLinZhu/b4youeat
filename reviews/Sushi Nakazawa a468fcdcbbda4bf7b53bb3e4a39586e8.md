# Sushi Nakazawa

Rating: ★★★★★★★★
To Post: No

A lowkey spot tucked away on a quiet street in West Village. Sushi Nakazawa has amazing quality fish at a reasonable price point. A ton of variety of cuts to experience, some of my favorite courses include the chutoro and amberjack. Definitely worth a visit, tho if it's your first omakase I would recommend a more entry level place before you work your way up. Shinn East is one of my favorites.
