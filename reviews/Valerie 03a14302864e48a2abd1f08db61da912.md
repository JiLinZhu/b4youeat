Came for drinks in the late evening, great for gin lovers. They also serve small appetizers pretty late into the evening, their truffle fries were delicious!

Valerie has a more upscale bar energy but can get busy and rowdy, especially near the bar. However, the back has restaurant like seating that has great ambience.

One of the few bars in the area that you can make reservations for, some definitely useful for busy nights where you want to make sure you can get in somewhere.
