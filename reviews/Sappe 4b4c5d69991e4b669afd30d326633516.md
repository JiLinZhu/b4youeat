# Sappe

To Post: No

The sister restaurant to Soothr, Sappe serves delicious and unique Thai cuisine in a lively, although sometimes too loud, atmosphere. My first impression walking in was the vibrant decor, accent lights, and ceiling mirrors everywhere. It’s a great spot to start the night if you’re feeling high energy. Just beware that the noise levels made it harder to have a conversation, especially during peak hours.

The highlights of the menu were definitely the skewers, in particular the chicken liver, though this may not be for everyone. The Zaab Hang (pork ribs) was another personal favorite, it was insanely flavorful and I loved the anchovy sauce. Beware that it is fishy though!

We also had the Tom Zaab Nuer (stewed beef) hotpot. A lot of people recommend this, but I found it underwhelming. The broth was delicious with a great balance of acidity, sweetness, and spices. There was just too much meat, and certain pieces were quite tough. In fact, the overall theme of the dinner was a lack of vegetables. I would recommend going out of your way to order some vegetables.

We finished up with the dessert, the Gluay Ping (grilled banana). Not really my cup of tea and pretty disappointing.

Overall, Sappe has a ton of potential but didn’t hit the mark in a few ways. The noise level was just too loud and some of the dishes were lacking. I do think it may be due to how we ordered though, perhaps it would have been better if we ordered a noodle dish and vegetables instead of all the meat options.
