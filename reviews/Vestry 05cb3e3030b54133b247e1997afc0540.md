Vestry, a Michelin-starred spot in Soho, offers a vegetable and seafood-focused menu in an elegant and intimate setting. The service was attentive and friendly, quick to seat us and bring water. We came for Restaurant Week with a fixed 3-course menu for $60 with a few options for each. Oddly, you were only allowed to choose 2 out of the 3 courses. 

We started by ordering bread, which was probably the best part of the meal—reminiscent of Japanese milk bread. It was fluffy, aromatic, and paired great with the equally delicious butter. 

I was expecting the Restaurant Week menu to highlight some of their best items, unfortunately, the rest of the meal was pretty disappointing. The grilled Hen of the Woods mushrooms were tasty but weren’t particularly exciting. I made the mistake of choosing wild mushroom risotto for the 2nd course. Somehow, risotto always sounds good yet always ends up disappointing and tasting like baby food… I’d rather eat congee.

Overall, Vestry didn't live up to its Michelin star. In particular, the Restaurant Week menu is especially bad, $60 + service for two average courses and no complimentary bread is an awful deal. Perhaps their regular menu is much better… guess I’ll never know.
