A “hidden” gem with delicious Korean comfort food in an elevated trendy space. I say “hidden” because it’s popular but doesn’t require reservations a week or more in advance like Take31, Atoboy, and similar restaurants. If you need a last minute spot, it won’t disappoint!

Olle has delicious dishes and awesome service, all in the perfect ambience for anything ranging from a date night to a big group dinner. You’ll be started with some refreshing barley tea as you settle into the elegant music, consisting of tasteful piano covers of pop songs like Viva La Vida.

The food was definitely the highlight here, tied for my favorite Korean food at this price with Ariari.
The bossom is amazing, super tender pork belly supported by sides to cut through the fattiness.
The gabli jjim is also a must try, but if that’s too much pure meat you can opt for their comforting soups, you can’t go wrong with their galbi or gamja tang.

My surprise favorite dish though was the mool naengmyeon. I usually don’t like cold noodles, in particular the use of pear or apple in this dish. But something about the balance of tangy, savory, and sweet made it perfect. I came here once completely full after eating an entire steak and still couldn’t get enough of this soup.

Definitely come give Olle a try, its awesome!
